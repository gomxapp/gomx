# GOMX

GOMX, as you may have guessed, is a portmanteau of Go and HTMX. While apps are intended to be built this way, a GOMX app can do much more.

Take a look at some [examples](https://github.com/winstonco/gomx/tree/main/examples) to see common patterns.

## Requirements

`Go v1.22`

## Getting Started

Install the GOMX CLI
```sh
go install github.com/winstonco/gomx
```
Create a new GOMX app
```sh
gomx new <name_of_gomx_app>
```

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure your go/bin is on your $PATH
